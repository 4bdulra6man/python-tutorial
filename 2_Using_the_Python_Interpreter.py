# Python is usually installed at /usr/local/bin/python3.13 or /usr/local/python on Unix-like systems.
# You can exit out of python interpreter by typing exit() or quit() or pressing Ctrl-D (on Unix) or Ctrl-Z (on Windows).
# Control+P check if the interactive editor is working.
# By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8.
# To declare an encoding other than UTF-8, a special comment should be placed at the top of the file, such as:
# -*- coding: <encoding name> -*-
# One exception to the first line rule is when the source code starts with a UNIX “shebang” line. In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file. For example:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
