# Before continue studying or review this again

## I summarised the python docs 'Tutorial' from the beginning to 'Using Lists as Queues' section at 'Data Structure' Section "<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#using-lists-as-queues>"

## I also studied OOP from freecodecamp youtube channel but didn't practice the code yet "<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLRZi0Gu8Go>"

## I didn't study 'Async-Python', 'Python-RegEx', 'MultiThreading & MultiProcessing'
